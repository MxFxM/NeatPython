# NeatPython
Implementation of neat algorithm in Python.

Inspired by Code-Bullet: https://github.com/Code-Bullet
and his: https://github.com/Code-Bullet/Google-Chrome-Dino-Game-AI

However this is only the neat part and completly re-written in Python (although I am keeping close to the source, at least until I am sure everything is working correctly).

I use pygame to visualize the network.
